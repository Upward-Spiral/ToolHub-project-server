Repository for the final project (server) - Ironhack web development bootcamp (Feb 2020)



# ToolHub (back-end)
### This project is built using Node.js and Express.

ToolHub is a hub for searching, finding, and borrowing/lending tools. People can offer the tools they don't use at the moment to be borrowed by others who need them for a project. They can also search trough the tools that others have offered, find the right one, and request to borrow (or reserve, based on the availability).
